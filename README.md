# tracker
Tracks who and what is where and when it got there. Each object has a name that starts with a letter or a number, exept for "all". To perform a command, you do <name> <command>. Commands are "in" for going in, "out" for going out, "log" for getting a log for that name in specified time period, and "logf" for getting a log as a file. You can use name "all" to perform that action for every member in the database. Data will be saved in save file specified in the first command line argument.
